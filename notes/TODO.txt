hmmm error checking .....

perhaps with non-terminating errors, set an error flag that prevents more checking until it is unset; this should happen at a statement level.




when searching for procedures, search all the way back and collect candidates in the entire 
imported package structure, warnings if some found with the same signature and name and error
if they have different return types, if same return type then just grab the one that is furthest 
DOWN in the import hierarchy!




circular reference in imports!


I think the following is legal:
  for (int i=-0,j=0; ..... ; )

non library procedures cannot use the word NATIVE either



Library files actual file name should match the name in the FILE pragma


Native library files CAN define ProcessJ constants - they just do not get
mapped to C!


#import kjdsfksjdkf makes the compiler fail 




what happens if we have name clashes in an import package.* between two differnt files.....


add ErrorType to visitor



file name are incorrect for imports in NameChecker due to explicit file or package/file target in invocations



libraries cannot have imports !!


no double imports!
no imports repeated that is
